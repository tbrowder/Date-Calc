# Date-Calc-Raku
Raku (aka Perl 6) port of Perl's module Date::Calc

This is a partial implementation of `Date::Calc`. Currently usable
functions are listed below.  Submit an issue if there is a `Date::Calc`
function you want added to the list.  Note functions are available
named as in the original module as well as in Raku's kebab case (with
all letters in lower case and underscores changed to hyphens). For
example, `Days_in_Year` will also be available as `days-in-year`.

For complete details of the module's contents, see the documentation
on the CPAN site for
[Date::Calc](htt[s://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Date-Calc/lib/Date/Calc.pod).
