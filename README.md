# Date::Calc

## A Raku (aka Perl 6) port of Perl's module Date::Calc

This is currently a partial implementation of `Date::Calc`. Currently usable
functions are listed below.  Submit an issue if there is a `Date::Calc`
function you want added to the list.  

Implemented functions are available with two naming systems:
(1) named as in the original module and (2) named in Raku's kebab case (with
all letters after the first in lower case and underscores changed to hyphens). For
example, `Days_in_Year` will also be available as `Days-in-year`.
(The case of the first letter is preserved to satisfy the convention
in the original Date::Calc that functions with lower-case first letters
in their names return Boolean values.)

For complete details of the module's contents, see the documentation
on the CPAN site for
[Date::Calc](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Date-Calc/lib/Date/Calc.pod).
